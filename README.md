# Can of Books

**Authors**: Scottie Houghton & Brentice Loper
**Version**: 1.0.1 

## Overview
* Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
* Install React and its Bootstrap and Axios libraries. You will also need Express JS and dotenv.
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
* React, React Bootstrap, Axios, Node.js, npm, JavaScript, CSS & HTML.

<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
* 06-27-2022 9:30pm - Application has a GET route to our server which is pulling data from our database. It renders the data from the database onto our page.
* 06-28-2022 2:00PM - Added an 'Add Book' button to the website, edited the code for the About Me, and added a Carousel with an image. 
* 06-29-2022 4:00PM - Added, updated, and fixed the Add, Delete, and Update buttons. Centered and made code pretty. 

<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->
